# AI-carabids
This project is focused on using deep learning models to identify carabid specimens through computer-vision using specimen images.

## Current Deployment
The current code is deployed here: http://146.190.35.99/AI-carabids/

## Included data and code

The Jupyter Notebooks included in this project contain the code used to generate CNN image classification models. The models themselves are not included in the repository to save disc space. Training images are similarly not included but are available on the NEON Biorepository portl: biorepo.neonscience.org

The API requires PHP and the python scripts need to be executable by the PHP files.
